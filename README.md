# STRUCTURE repeats
Repeated runs for each assumed population (K)

Running STRUCTURE is a time-consuming and boring task, particular for people who used windows version of STRCTURE for this purpose. Here I used the bash shell script to create multiple folders that allow repeated runs for different Ks. With these scripts, I can finish 100 runs of STRUCTURE within in few hours.
